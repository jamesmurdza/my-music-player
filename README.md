# AI Music Chatbot

This is a small app I made using NextJS and Tambo to create a helpful assistant that will find and play songs for you.

Features:
- Supports OpenAI models
- Integrates with the Deezer API
- Responsive user interface

## Installation

1. Set up the Tambo integration:
```bash
tambo init
```

2. Install depdencies:
```
npm install
```

3. Run the application:
```
npm run dev
```

## Usage

Once the development server is running, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. You can then interact with the AI Music Chatbot to find and play songs.
